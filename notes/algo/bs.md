# Binary Search


### These are the five algorithms for ascending order respectively in the order of the index of required element in array:

1) Binary Search for strictly increasing Array (Basic Binary Search)
2) Binary Search for Last element < Key
3) Binary Search Lower Bound (First Element >= Key)
4) Binary Search for Last element <= Key
5) Binary Search Upper Bound (First Element > Key)

### Their corresponding decreasing array counterparts:

1) Binary Search for strictly decreasing Array (Basic Binary Search)
2) Binary Search Last Element > Key
3) Binary Search Lower Bound (First Element <= Key)
4) Binary Search Last Element >= Key
5) Binary Search Upper Bound (First Element < Key)
